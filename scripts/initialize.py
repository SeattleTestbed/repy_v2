<Purpose>
  This script does a "git clone" of all the dependent repositories
  of a Seattle component.

<Usage>
  * Clone the repository you would like to build on your machine, e.g. using 
      "git clone https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/seash"
  
  * Change into the "scripts" subdirectory
  
  * Run this script: "python initialize.py [-s]"
  
  * The dependencies will be checked out into "../DEPENDENCIES"
  
  *"initialize.py" will get the list of dependencies to check-out from
    "config_initialize.txt" file.
  
  * During check-out, if there is a readme file associated with a repository,
    then it will be printed on terminal.  Once this is done, run the build.py
    script to import the necessary files into a desired target folder.  Run
    build file as: "python build.py"

  The "-s" command-line option is optional, and activates skip mode.  Skip
  mode is useful to

  (1) Save you from re-downloading stuff that you have on your local machine
  (and can copy over via "cp -R" or similar).
  
  (2) Test local modifications that you have in your working copy without
  having to first commit them somewhere and then hack the init config, but
  
  Skip mode does not check whether the repos that exist in "DEPENDENCIES/" are
  complete, in a working state, or are on the branch specified in
  "config_initialize.txt".  Consequently, while skip mode sounds like a good
  thing to have if you want to pick up the initialization process again after
  interrupting it, it is also pretty dangerous (as in: weird build/runtime
  problems) and should be used with extreme care.

<Note>
  While this file is redistributed with every buildable Seattle repo, 
  the "master copy" (and thus the most up-to-date version) is kept 
  at: https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/buildscripts
