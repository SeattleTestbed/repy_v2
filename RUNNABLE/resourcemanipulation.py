   Description:

   This class handles resource specifications.   It used to handle 
   restricting access to functions, but that has been removed in favor of
   security layers.
   This module is supposed to be readable and obviously correct.  

   This is only supposed to specify what resources are assigned to a vessel.
   It does not cover tracking resource use over time, etc.
