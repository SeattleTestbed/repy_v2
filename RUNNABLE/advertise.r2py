  <Purpose>
    Helper function to be used in parallel with other advertise requests. 
    This is the function we pass to parallelize to perform simultaneous 
    queries.

  <Arguments>
    args (tuple)
      A tuple containing the following:
        which_service (string)
          The service we should use to advertise, such as "central" or "UDP".
        key (string)
          The advertisement key. For most nodes, this will be a public key.
        value (string)
          The advertisement value to be assigned to key.
        ttlval (int)
          Time To Live for this advertisement, in seconds.
        exceptions (List reference, should literally be [''])
          An empty list reference which will be have exception data in its zero 
          index if something goes wrong. Due to this method's parallelized nature, 
          we cannot simply return this data; it is not invoked by this module.
        finishedref (List with boolean in zero index)
          This function sets finishedref[0] = true when it has completed 
          successfully. This is used as a flag so that we know when to return 
          advertise data to the client later.

  <Exceptions>
    AdvertiseError
      If an invalid service type is specified, this exception will be raised.
    ValueError
      Too many, or too few values passed in the args tuple.

  <Side Effects>
    Contingent on the side effects of the modules invoked for different 
    services, this consumes an outsocket and insocket on use. Therefore, 
    invoking too many instances of these in parallel can lead to crashing 
    if the application exceeds its allotted socket count.

    The number of sockets permitted to an application is determined by 
    its associated restrictions file.

  <Returns>
    None

  """
  <Purpose>
    Announce (PUT) a key : value pair to all default advertise services.

  <Arguments>
    key (string)
      The key for our advertise dictionary entry.

    value (string)
      The value for our advertise dictionary entry.

    ttlval (int)
      Time in seconds to persist the associated key<->value pair.
    
    concurrentevents (int) (optional)
      How many services to announce on in parallel.

    graceperiod (float) (optional)
      Amount of time to wait before returning, provided at least one of the 
      parallel attempts has finished.

      Note that even when this method returns, parallelized announce attempts may
      still be running. These will terminate in relatively short order, but be 
      aware of this. It could be a problem, for example, if you tried to set graceperiod 
      very low to send rapid-fire queries to the advertise servers. This would 
      probably cause you to exceed your allotted outsockets. (This is only 
      possible if your timeout value is greater than your graceperiod value.)

      In short, graceperiod is a "soft" timeout. Provided at least one query has 
      been confirmed, the method will return after graceperiod seconds at most.
      If none return, this could run all the way till timeout.

    timeout (int) (optional)
      Absolute allowed time before returning. Provided the method has not 
      returned by now, successful or not, it will terminate after timeout seconds.

  <Exceptions>
    AdvertiseError if something goes wrong.

    number of services available (currently 2). Each worker event consumes one 
    insocket and one outsocket until it is finished.
