Description:
Provides a means of multiplexing any stream-like connection into a multiple
socket-like connections.

Details:
There are 3 main objects in the Multiplexer
++ MultiplexerFrame
-- This objects is like a meta-"packet" in that it encapsulates a some data with a header
-- The header allows the Multiplexer to route the data to the correct destination

++ Multiplexer
-- This object is takes a single stream-like object that has the properties of being
-- in-order and lossless and multiplexes that single connection into any number of virtual connections.
-- At its heart, there is one thread the socketReader which reads all incoming data and either evaluates control messages
-- or buffers data for clients

++ MultiplexerSocket
-- When the multiplexer creates virtual sockets, a MultiplexerSocket is returned. This socket is tied to its parent multiplexer
-- since that parent buffers all of the incoming data for this socket. 

These three objects are wrapped in several mux_* functions, which abstract the details of the Multiplexer
and provide a repy like interface for easily multiplexing a normal TCP connection. mux_remap can be used to
multiplex any type of connection.
