Module for printing clean tracebacks.   It takes the python traceback and 
makes the output look nicer so the programmer can tell what is happening...

def format_exception():
  """
  <Purpose>
    Creates a string containing traceback and debugging information
    for the current exception that is being handled in this thread.

  <Side Effects>
    Calls sys.exc_clear(), so that we know this current exception has been
    "handled".

    NOTE WELL:
      Ensure that this function does not raise excpetions itself (even 
      if it handles them). This will override the original exception 
      we are trying to handle, and `sys.exc_info` / `sys.exc_clear` will 
      not do the right thing. For reference, see the Python 2 docs:
      https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info

  <Returns>
    A human readable string containing debugging information. Returns
    None if there is no exception being handled.

  This is an example traceback:
  ---
  Following is a full traceback, and a user traceback.
  The user traceback excludes non-user modules. The most recent call is displayed last.

  <Author>
    Brent Couvrette
  <Purpose>
    When an internal error happens in repy it should be handled differently 
    than normal exceptions, because internal errors could possibly lead to
    security vulnerabilities if we aren't careful.  Therefore when an internal
    error occurs, we will not return control to the user's program.  Instead
    we will log the error to the service log if available, then terminate.
  <Arguments>
    error_string - The error string to be logged if logging is enabled.
    exitcode - The exit code to be used in the harshexit call.
  <Exceptions>
    None
  <Side Effects>
    The program will exit.
  <Return>
    Shouldn't return because harshexit will always be called.
