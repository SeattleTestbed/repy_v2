# Travis integration file.
# Seattle supports Python 2.6 through 2.7, per
# github.com/SeattleTestbed/docs/blob/master/Contributing/BuildInstructions.md
# Python 2.5 is included for testing because this is what PlanetLab runs
#
# Travis provides OS X and Linux (specifically Ubuntu) OS instances.
# The result of this configuration will be five separate builds on
# Travis-CI VMs, 3 python versions on Linux and 2 on OS X.

# Primarily because of some manual fiddling to get python 2.5 tests
# to work, we require the following directive - we need
# non-container-based infrastructure so that Travis allows us to use
# sudo.
sudo: required

      env: Python='2.7' PythonBin="python" # These are environment variables we'll use.
        # In particular, PythonBin will specify the location of the python binary to use.
        # The "Python" env variable there is redundant except for OS X runs below.

    # Because Travis-CI no longer offers the 2.5 environment by default,
    # we'll manually install 2.5.... It's not even available on the common
    # ubuntu repos, so we'll use the well-known deadsnakes repo.

    # OS X Instances follow
    # There is no OS X + PYTHON combination available by default, so we
    # use the "language: generic" directive and we'll install python
    # ourselves through some install directives.

    # OS X python 2.6.9
    # We have to use pyenv to compile and install Python 2.6.9
    # ourselves for OS X, as Travis-CI offers no OS X Python
    # environments, and homebrew no longer offers a python26
    # recipe.
