<Description>
  This module provides the VirtualNamespace object. This object allows
  arbitrary code to be checked for safety, and evaluated within a
  specified global context.

      Initializes the VirtualNamespace class.

      code:
          (String) The code to run in the namespace

      name:
          (String, optional) The name to use for the code. When the module is
          being executed, if there is an exception, this name will appear in
          the traceback.

    <Exceptions>
      A safety check is performed on the code, and a CodeUnsafeError exception will be raised
      if the code fails the safety check. 

      If code or name are not string types, a RepyArgumentError exception will be raised.

    <Purpose>
      Evaluates the wrapped code within a context.

    <Arguments>
      context: A global context to use when executing the code.
      This should be a SafeDict object, but if a dict object is provided
      it will automatically be converted to a SafeDict object.

    <Exceptions>
      Any that may be raised by the code that is being evaluated.
      A RepyArgumentError exception will be raised if the provided context is not
      a safe dictionary object or a ContextUnsafeError if the
      context is a dict but cannot be converted into a SafeDict.

    <Returns>
      The context dictionary that was used during evaluation.
      If the context was a dict object, this will be a new
      SafeDict object. If the context was a SafeDict object,
      then this will return the same context object.
