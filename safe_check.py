Description:
  This simple script reads "code" from stdin, and runs safe.safe_check() on it.
  The resulting return value or exception is serialized and written to stdout.
  The purpose of this script is to be called from the main repy.py script so that the
  memory used by the safe.safe_check() will be reclaimed when this process quits.
